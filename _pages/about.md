I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems](http://cfins.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yilin Mo](https://yilinmo.github.io/). Prior to that, I received B.E. from Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2020, and was a visiting student at [Social Sensing Lab](https://www.wangdong.org/sslab/index.html), University of Notre Dame in 2018.

My current research interests include adaptive control and its application to robotics. I am interested in understanding the theoretical properties of the "learning for control" scheme, as well as developing practical algorithms for controlling real-world systems.
